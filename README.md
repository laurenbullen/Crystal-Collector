Crystal Collector

The goal of this game is to click on the crystals, each assigned an unknown value, and have the final value of your clicked crystals add up to the Goal Number. As the crystals are clicked, the values of each crystal will be added to get Your Score.

If the value of your clicked crystals (Your Score) equals the value of the displayed Goal Number, a win will be added to your Wins tally.

If the value of your clicked crystals (Your Score) goes over the value of the displayed Goal Number, a lose will be added to your Loses tally.

After each win and lose, the game will reset to give you a new Goal Number and values for each crystal. Your Score will be reset to 0.
